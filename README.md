Workbook from the course [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-building-system/lesson/1/introduction) on [DeepLearning.AI](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/).

Since I'm more comfortable in NodeJS than Python, I duplicated the jupyter lesson notebooks to NodeJS scripts.

#### Contents

- [Lesson 1: Introduction](./lesson1.js)
- [Lesson 2: Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens](./lesson2.js)
- [Lesson 3: Classification](./lesson3.js)
- [Lesson 4: Moderation](./lesson4.js)
- [Lesson 5: Chain of Thought Reasoning](./lesson5.js)
- [Lesson 6: Chaining Prompts](./lesson6.js)
- [Lesson 7: Check Outputs](./lesson7.js)

  ... skipped the nodejs rewriting because these lessons used utils

  ... for some of the data manipulation

  ... that would have been of no benefit to convert

- [Lesson 10: Evaluate Outputs](./lesson10.js)
